# TryHackMe — Personal Learning Repository

A structured collection of notes, writeups, methodologies and lessons learned while completing rooms and paths on **TryHackMe**.  
This repository serves as my long-term knowledge base for pentesting, cybersecurity and practical offensive techniques.

## 🎯 Purpose of this Repository

This project is built to:

- Document my full learning journey on TryHackMe.
- Store room-by-room writeups with explanations, commands, screenshots and attack paths.
- Build a reusable knowledge base for pentesting and cybersecurity.
- Track what I’ve learned, what tools I used, and what skills improved over time.
- Organize content exactly by TryHackMe paths and rooms.
- Prepare for certifications (PNPT, OSCP, Security+, etc.).

This mirrors how TryHackMe structures its learning paths so I can return to any room and quickly refresh the knowledge.

## 🧭 How I Document Each Room

### `notes.md`
- Summary of the room  
- What I learned  
- Concepts explained  
- Tools involved  
- Commands with explanations  
- Interesting findings  

### `attack-path.md`
A clean and structured exploit flow:
1. Enumeration  
2. Vulnerability discovery  
3. Exploitation  
4. Privilege escalation  
5. Loot  
6. What I should improve next time  

### `answers.md`
Optional — task answers for quick revision.

## 🧠 Toolbox

Reusable long-term knowledge lives here:

### Included tools and templates:
- **Common Commands** → Nmap, FFUF, Gobuster, SQLmap, Hydra, SSH, SMB, etc.
- **Enumeration Templates** → quick-start templates for any CTF or real engagement.
- **Cheatsheets** → Linux privesc, Windows privesc, AD attacks, web payloads.
- **Methodology** → my personal pentesting flow for assessments.

This prevents me from forgetting techniques learned in previous rooms.

## 📚 Why I Created This

During cybersecurity learning, it's easy to forget:
- how a specific exploit was performed  
- which command solved a given task  
- how an enumeration step revealed a vulnerability  
- how a full attack chain looked  

This repository acts as my knowledge base — something I can return to anytime and instantly recall everything learned.

## 📌 Future plans

- Full documentation of the entire Jr Penetration Tester path  
- Writeups for Offensive Pentesting path  
- OSCP-style methodology section  
- Python/Bash scripts for automation  
- Optionally convert this repository into an Obsidian vault or MkDocs website
